# REV LED Indicator

A REV LED Indicator using [ArduinoOBD2](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-OBD2) and [ArduinoCAN](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-CAN).

Currently using a Arduino UNO with a CAN Bus Shield MCP2515. The CAN Bus Shield is then connected using a VGA to OBD2 cable to connect with the car. The LED's I'm using are WS2812B

See the library's above for compatible hardware.
